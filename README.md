```
##### Dependencies Installation
```bash
cd backend
pnpm install
```
##### Run locally in mode Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```
##### Run locally in mode Debug
```bash
pnpm debug
```
##### Use eslint to check code quality
```bash

This is optional , for developmenet purpose , no need to install it in production mode.
```bash
pnpm type
```
##### Build

pnpm start
```
#### Bash Scripts
##### install.sh
```bash
sudo chmod +w+x install.sh
./install.sh
```
By Default the script is intended to prompt for:
- Node version
- Build Mode (Devlopment | Production)
- User ownership
But it can also be passed as parameters
```bash
./install.sh --username=www-data --node=21 --mode=development
```
#### Docker installation
##### Use Dockerfile
```bash
# build container
docker build -t api-server .
docker run -t -i \
      --env NODE_ENV=production \
      -p 3000:3000 \
      api-server
```
- -t is used to tag an image. When you build an image with Docker, you can assign it a name and optionally a tag to reference it more easily later. The tag is often used to specify the version of the image.
- -d means running container in background and print container ID.
- -p for port mapping. Port mapping is used to access the services running inside a Docker container. We open a host port to give us access to a corresponding open port inside the Docker container. The above command launches an httpd container and maps the hostâ€™s port 5000 to port 80 inside that container. By default, the httpd server listens on port 80. So now, we can access the application using port 5000 on the host machine.
- -name is for the container name. Here you can use any name you prefer.
